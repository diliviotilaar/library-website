# Library Website Project
There is a "static" folder containing CSS files and images used, a "Templates" folder containing HTML files, a Python file named "app.py" which serves as the backend (Flask) of this website project, and a MySQL database file named "library_project.sql".
To see an example of how this website looks, you can view the file Library_Website_Project_Summary.pdf.
